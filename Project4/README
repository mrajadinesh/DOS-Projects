Project 4.1 - Twitter Simulator Report
--------------------------------------


Overview:
---------

Functionalities implemented in the Server:
------------------------------------------
Twitter server gets "Number of Users per Client" and "Number of Clients" as input. It initializes data structures for holding the Tweets of all users and for holding the Hashtagged Tweets. It also creates a lists of 100 randomly generated hashtags. It handles GET requests from clients for getting the tweets for a particular user and for getting the tweets for a particular hashtag. It handles POST requests from clients for posting normal tweets, @mentions tweets, hashtagged tweets and retweets.

Functionalities implemented in the Client:
------------------------------------------
Twitter Client gets "Server IP Address" and "Client Number" as input. It initializes data structure for holding the users and their followers. It gets the list of hashtags that are maintained by the server. Once it gets initialized with all the required information, it starts posting tweets and getting tweets from server for random users (in a loop with random delays). Peaks are simulated by making a set of users to post hashtagged tweets and to post retweets.


Observations:
-------------
We were able to run both the server and client without any problem for 10 minutes on lin116-xx machines in the CISE Computer lab. Our observations are consolidated below:

1) With 1 Server and 1 Client:
------------------------------
Number of POST requests per second is around 10100
Number of POST requests per second during peaks is around 10700
Number of GET requests per seconds is around 9500
Total number of POST requests received by server in 10 minutes is 6246795
Total number of GET requests received by server in 10 minutes is 5802162

2) With 1 Server and 2 Clients:
-------------------------------
Number of POST requests per second is around 20000
Number of POST requests per second during peaks is around 21000
Number of GET requests per seconds is around 19000
Total number of POST requests received by server in 10 minutes is 11956003
Total number of GET requests received by server in 10 minutes is 11111148


Readings:
---------

1) With 1 Server and 1 Client:
------------------------------
Total time the simulator was run: 10 minutes
Total Number of Users: 20000

Below are the readings taken during the last 50 seconds in the 10th minute:

To build project4client.scala:
------------------------------
a) Open command prompt.
b) Navigate to "Project4\scala-2.11.2\bin" path and issue the following command:
./scalac -cp "../../akka/*:../../scala-library-2.11.2.jar:." ../../project4client.scala

To run project4server.scala as server:
--------------------------------------
a) Change the hostname in application.conf file to the server's IP Address. Leave the port number as it is.
b) Open command prompt.
c) Navigate to "Project4\scala-2.11.2\bin" path and issue the following command. 
./scala -cp "../../akka/*:../../scala-library-2.11.2.jar:." project4server <NumUsersPerClient> <NumClients>

To run project4client.scala as client:
--------------------------------------
a) Change the hostname in application.conf file to the clients's IP Address and change the port number to 0.
b) Open command prompt.
c) Navigate to "Project4\scala-2.11.2\bin" path and issue the following command:
./scala -cp "../../akka/*:../../scala-library-2.11.2.jar:." project4client <ServerIpAddress> <ClientNum>
